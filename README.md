# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repository contains the script, codebook, and other associated documents with the course project.

## Course project description
 As mentioned in the submission page of the project, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The final goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. It is required to submit: 
 1. a tidy data set 
 2. a link to a github repository containing the script for performing the analysis. 
 3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformation carried out to clean up the data.
 
## Background and data
One of the most exciting areas in the field of data science right now is wearable computing. Different companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used in this project represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The use of the data set is acknowledged from the following publication:
Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012. 

The specific data used in this project are downloaded from following link (accessed 21 October 2015):

## Project requirements
Student should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.   
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
